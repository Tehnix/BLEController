# Doors
An app for iOS that can control a Red Bear Lab BLE Shield attached to an Arduino. The purpose of the setup is to be able to lock/unlock a door, by having the Arduino control a servo motor that will be attached to the lock on the door.

# iOS code
The iOS code is written in Swift 2, targeting iOS9 (but should work on earlier versions). The code can be found in the `Doors` folder, which contains the code for the app, and the xcode project.


# Arduino sketch
Coming soon...

## Arduino code
The code for the Arduino board and the libraries are included in the `Arduino` folder.
